================

Feel free to use whatever code you might find interesting in this repo. Also, any feedback is highly appreciated! Keep in mind that I am in no way a professional programmer - I am merely a dedicated software engineering student who likes to play around. 

The project uses the external library SDL with the extension SDL_image. In order to build the project, you will need to have these libraries installed and linked properly.
