 # SDL-playground

Feel free to use whatever code you might find interesting in this repo. Also, any feedback is highly appreciated! I am a software engineering student still in the process of learning, so all problem solutions might not be optimal.

The project uses the external library SDL with the extension SDL_image. In order to build the project, you will need to have these libraries installed and linked properly. 

To run the current instance of the game, download the "executable" directory, and run the file SDLtest.exe. Remember that this is simply a test program with very few features implemented yet, so it might not be very interesting at this point. If you do run the program, the ship is moved forward using W and is turned using A and D. I have intentionally left out any friction, so be sure not to get lost in space!
