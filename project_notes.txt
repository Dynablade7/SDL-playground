- Use an EnvironmentData object that each MapObject has a pointer to, maybe? They need to be aware of their surroundings, after all, especially when it comes to stuff like movement.


- Check collisions using quad-tree?


- Use something similar to the State pattern to handle different weapons/abilities for the different ships' different parts. A nice, general solution. And different. (lol)
- Use macros as debugging flag!
- Implement a general rotation method in the MapObject base class
